# SQLite for SWI-Prolog
The purpose of swiplite is to enable using sqlite3
databases comfortably from SWI-Prolog, without sacrificing
efficiency.

The [`sqlite` module](prolog/sqlite.pl) provides low-level
access to the connection and statement objects.

## Installation
This section is work in progress.

The intention is to distribute this through GitHub, using their
releases. Since it is relatively easy, I also plan to have
a release that does bundle the SQLite amalgamation, and a
release that does not bundle it.
